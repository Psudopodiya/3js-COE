    -   feat: New feature
    -   fix: Bug fix
    -   docs: Changes to documentation
    -   style: Code formatting, no logic changes
    -   refactor: Code change without feature/fix
    -   test: Add/update tests
    -   chore: Build process, dependencies, etc.

-   scope (optional): A noun referring to the part of the codebase affected (e.g., feat(api): ...)
